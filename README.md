# Intro

Basically it is said to try to do a project of choice on each new
language that you learn for a faster learning curve.
My project of choice here is sudoku and you will find kind of the same
implementation of a sudoku solver but in different languages.

# Implementations

For now the available implementations are:

+ C
+ 32 bit arm
